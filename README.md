# IMAGE DATA HANDLING SYSTEM FOR RESEARCH
___

This is a project to develop a web application for researchers to store images related to their research topic, and annotate them. 
These data will be used in future applications of the research area.

Example Application-
In oral cancer detection, doctors often need to analyse oral cavities of a patient to identify abnormalities of the cavity area and to detect early stages of cancer. But this process is time consuming and takes a lot of effort, individually. 
As a solution, we can automate the abnormality detecting process. This would save time as well as the effort needed. But for this to work, we need to train a Machine Learning model by using many images of oral cavities.
Then the below problem arises. 
How to annotate images, store and import them in digital format?
This application is developed as an answer to the above question.
It can be used for any research area. The image data can be imported and used in any other application.
